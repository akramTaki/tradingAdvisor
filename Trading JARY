 Understanding Trading "PAST - PRESENT - FUTURE"

We are using history as a predictor for the present and future investment opportunities.

## Past*
We aim at studying the stock prices of most popular organisations for the past 10 years. We have compared the profit a user can acheive had they invested their stock in a particular company xx no of years back and how much value the investment will have generate today.
Eg: If you have invested $1000usd 5 years back in Tesla stock, the value of that stock could have accelerated to around 8500 USD today and you will have over $7500usd in gains.

## Present*
Of course, Our coding in python is designed is such a way that as long you are aware of the ticker symbol, we can generate the stock values of just any company for any given period of time, including the current date. 

We have used 4 commonly used Trading indicators to define the BUY/SELL decision making for stock over a period of time and understand the signal for Entry and Exit to buy/sell the stock.



## Future*
While future is unpredictable,  we have tried incorporating Machine Learning to predict long term prices.

*This has been depicted in the graphs attached herewith.
